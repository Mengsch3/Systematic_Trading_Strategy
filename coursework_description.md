# Coursework

## Overview

This year's coursework asks you to build a **metamodel** on top of a primary trading signal that we provide for **11 instruments across three asset classes**. The metamodel's job is to predict, for each primary signal, the probability that following it would be profitable under a triple-barrier exit rule.

This is a **group project** completed in teams of **5 students** (26 groups in total). The coursework is marked out of **100**.

## The Universe

You are provided with the primary model's daily signals (-1, 0, +1) for the following 11 instruments.

### Equity Index Futures

| Ticker| Index|
| ---| ---|
| **ES1S**| S&P 500|
| **NQ1S**| Nasdaq 100|
| **FESX1S**| Euro Stoxx 50|

| **NG1S**| Natural Gas|

### Metals

| Ticker| Metal|
| ---| ---|
| **GC1S**| Gold|
| **SI1S**| Silver|
| **HG1S**| Copper|
| **PL1S**| Platinum|

You are required to cover **at least one full asset class**. Covering more (up to all 11 instruments) is optional.

## Task Description

Build a metamodel for each instrument you cover. The metamodel takes the primary signal plus your features and outputs a **probability in [0, 1]** that the bet is worth taking.

The pipeline is:

1. Feature engineering from OHLCV (and anything else you can derive)
2. Labeling via the **triple-barrier method**, as taught in the course
3. Training and comparing several ML models with hyperparameter tuning
4. Feature importance analysis at the cluster level
5. Evaluation on a clean out-of-sample period
6. (Optional) Strategy construction on top of the metamodel probabilities

### Marking Scheme

| Section| Marks|
| ---| ---|
| Feature Engineering| 20|
| Labeling (Triple-Barrier Method)| 20|
| Model Development and Comparison| 30|
| Feature Importance Analysis (Cluster-Level)| 10|
| Model Evaluation| 20|
| **Total**| **100**|
| Optional: Strategy Construction (Competition)| +10 bonus|

The bonus is capped so the final mark does not exceed 100.

### 1. Feature Engineering (20 marks) 📊

Build a rich feature set drawing on the techniques covered in the course:

- Technical indicators
- Latent variable models (GMM, HMM)
- Any of the unsupervised learning methods we discussed
- Anything else you can justify

**Be as creative as possible.** Document what each feature is meant to capture.

### 2. Labeling: Triple-Barrier Method (20 marks) 🏷️

Apply the triple-barrier method as taught in the course. You must justify your choice of barrier widths and time-limit.

### 3. Model Development and Comparison (30 marks) 🤖

We expect **at least three models with hyperparameter tuning**, drawn from across the three families:

- **Linear models** (e.g. Logistic Regression with regularization)
- **Tree-based models** (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Neural networks** (e.g. Variable Selection Network or Sequential Neural Networks)

Present a clear comparison: which model wins, on which metric, and why you think so.

### 4. Feature Importance Analysis: Cluster-Level (10 marks) 🔍

Beyond per-feature importance, compute importance at the **cluster level**:

- Cluster correlated features together
- Apply MDI, MDA, or SHAP at the cluster level
- Discuss which feature groups drive your metamodel

### 5. Model Evaluation (20 marks) 📈

Evaluate on an out-of-sample period that you carve out cleanly from the training period.

- Classification metrics: precision, recall, F1, AUC
- Confusion matrix and decision-threshold analysis
- **Per-instrument breakdown** (the metamodel may help on some instruments and not others, say so)
- Comparison against a baseline that follows the primary signal blindly

### Optional: Strategy Construction, Competition Track (10 bonus marks) 💹

For groups that want to compete: use the metamodel probabilities to build a position-sizing strategy on top of the primary signal, either on a single asset class or on the full 11-instrument universe.

**Full constraints (position limits, gross/net exposure, rebalancing rules, target volatility) will be released on Wednesday 20 May.**

Backtest metrics to report:

- CAGR
- Annualised volatility
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Average holding period
- Turnover

## Dataset

Two CSV files are available on **Insendi under Coursework**:

### `ohlcv_data.csv`

Daily OHLCV history for all 11 instruments. One row per (instrument, date).

| Column| Description|
| ---| ---|
| `date`| Trading date (YYYY-MM-DD)|
| `instrument`| Lowercase ticker (e.g. `cl1s`, `es1s`, `gc1s`)|
| `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`| Continuous-contract prices|
| `volume`| Daily volume|
| `open_interest`| Daily open interest|

History starts in 1990 for most instruments. Equity Index futures start later: ES1S in 1997, FESX1S in 1998, NQ1S in 1999.

### `primary_signals.csv`

Daily primary model signals from January 2020 onwards. One row per date, one column per instrument.

| Column| Description|
| ---| ---|
| `date`| Trading date (YYYY-MM-DD)|
| `es1s`, `nq1s`, ..., `pl1s`| Primary signal in {-1, 0, +1}|

The signal convention is:

- `+1`: the primary model wants to go **long** that day
- `-1`: the primary model wants to go **short** that day
- `0`: no position taken by the primary model

**Important.** The data we release covers up to **30 June 2022**. The final **6 months** of data (July to December 2022) are held out and will be used as a hidden test set to evaluate your final submission.

## Evaluation

You will be judged on:

1. Quality and creativity of your feature engineering 💡
2. Rigour of your labeling and validation protocol 🛡️
3. Appropriateness of your model selection and comparison 🧠
4. Critical analysis of your results 🔬
5. Code quality, reproducibility, and documentation 📝

**The score is focused entirely on methodology, not on performance.** You can score a high mark even if your metamodel does not beat the primary signal.

🌟🌟🌟 The best submission, judged on **quality of research** rather than performance, will be **presented to the research team at Alken Asset Management, with an interview for an internship at the end of it.**

## Getting Started

### Programming Sessions

For implementation guidance, refer to **all programming sessions and optional programming sessions** of the course.

## Submission Rules

- **Group size:** 5 students per group, 26 groups in total
- **One submission per group:** a single combined submission

### 2. Required: Metamodel Predictions

Format: one row per (date, instrument, prediction).

```

### 3. Optional: Strategy Weights

For groups competing on the strategy track, an additional CSV covering the first half of 2022:

```
